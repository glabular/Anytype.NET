# Anytype API for .NET

**Anytype\.NET** is a strongly-typed .NET client for the Anytype API. 
It simplifies interaction with the API by taking care of HTTP calls, request/response handling, and JSON parsing — letting you focus on building features.
With it, you can easily create, retrieve, update, and manage Anytype objects directly in your applications.
